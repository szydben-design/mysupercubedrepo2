:::{#me}
I am originally from New Jersey and a recent resident of New Hampshire. I enjoy backpacking, fishing, traveling, and spending time with friends and family.

## Goals
While at UNH, I will be studying mortality of fisher in New Hampshire, focusing on several dozen radio-collared individuals. I intend to complete my Master's degree in the next two years and continue to live in New England afterwards. 

## Education
I received my Bachelor's degree in Wildlife Biology from the University of Vermont in 2017.

## Experience
Before starting my MSc in Wildlife and Conservation Biology at UNH in 2025, I’ve spent the previous 8 years with several conservation field jobs. I’ve held positions radio-collaring black bears and bobcats in Connecticut and most recently I’ve led conservation-based field semesters in Botswana, southern Arizona and northwestern British Columbia.
