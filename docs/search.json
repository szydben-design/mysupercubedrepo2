I enjoy backpacking, fishing, traveling, and spending time with friends and family.\n\n\nWhile at UNH, I will be studying mortality of fisher in New Hampshire, focusing on several dozen radio-collared individuals. I intend to complete my Master’s degree in the next two years and continue to live in New England afterwards.\n\n\n\nI received my Bachelor’s degree in Wildlife Biology from the University of Vermont in 2017.\n\n\n\nBefore starting my MSc in Wildlife and Conservation Biology at UNH in 2025, I’ve spent the previous 8 years with several conservation field jobs. I’ve held positions radio-collaring black bears and bobcats in Connecticut and most recently I’ve led conservation-based field semesters in Botswana, southern Arizona and northwestern British Columbia.\nThanks for checking out my web site!"
